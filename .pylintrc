# We disable the following inspections:
# 1. f-string-without-interpolation (we allow f-strings that don't do any
#    formatting for consistent looks and for future safety)
# 2. inherit-non-class ("Inheriting 'NamedTuple', which is not a class" false
#    positive, see: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3876)
# 3. too-few-public-methods (produces false positives)
# 4. inspections incompatible with Black (see https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/compatible_configs.md#why-those-options-above-2)
#    C0330: Wrong hanging indentation before block (add 4 spaces) see
#    C0326: Bad whitespace
