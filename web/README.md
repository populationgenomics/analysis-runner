# Web server

This is a simple proxy that serves static content from the access-restricted per-dataset [`web` buckets](https://github.com/populationgenomics/team-docs/tree/main/storage_policies#web-gscpg-stack-web).

It's deployed manually, by triggering the corresponding [workflow](../.github/workflows/deploy_web_server.yaml).
